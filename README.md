### Proposal ###
The wesbite is called Bantero. The website will allow registered users to engage in online discussions (aka banter :)) and unregistered users to view discussions. The goal is to produce a service that allows users to register, post, and make comments on items. Additionally, unregistered users must be able to view the content but will not be able to edit or comment on posts. 

### Requirements ###
Registered users
- login
- edit account
- make posts in a discussion
  - upload photos / videos
  - write hyperinks
  - write title
  - write post body
- comment on posts
  - upload photos / videos
  - write hyperlinks
  - write title
  - write body
- upvote/like posts
- follow discussions
- navigate through posts
- navigate through website pages

Unregistered users
- sign up for an account
- view posts and comments
- navigate through posts
- navigate through website pages

Administration
- view posts and comments
- sign into the administration account
- remove posts and comments
- delete users
- resolve user issues
  - forgotten passwords

### Functional Requirements (from assignment requirements)

- Data storage in MySQL
- Appropriate security for data
- Site must maintain state (user state being logged on, etc)

- User images (thumbnail) and profile stored in database
- Simple discussion (topics) grouping and display
- Navigation breadcrumb strategy (i.e. user can determine where they are in threads)
